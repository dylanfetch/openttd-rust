 * acyclic chain until destroy; original valid-index/divisor/bit-shift preconditions
 * apply. No hard depth/range enum limit is imposed. No typed history/scratch data
 * or callbacks enter Rust; all typed operations/exceptions occur between calls.
 * Age/phase use native uint32 arithmetic. Rust owns the engine/frame allocations,
 * returned to its destroy function exactly once; no C++ allocator/layout crosses.
 * Panic/OOM abort, never unwind. Handles are nonnull and exclusively accessed.

/* One serialized game-thread owner holds the rail-change counter and six cache
 * banks. Searches hold private arenas/queues and per-search segments. The opaque
 * context and copied leaves live through destruction. Synchronous leaves are
 * noexcept and cannot reenter rail YAPF; tile/write operations access canonical
 * map/PBS services only. No C++ object or STL layout is viewed by Rust.
 * step returns action=1 before station randomisation + animation (in that order)
 * and releases ALL Rust borrows. The next step resumes the exact interrupted
 * reservation traversal. Destroy once, also if an ordinary station callback
 * throws. Map replacement during a reservation violates the original lifetime.
 * output writes caller outputs immediately at original mutation points. Write
 * operations: 0 mark dirty, 1 try track, 2 unreserve track, 3 reserve platform
 * tile+mark, 4 clear platform tile, 5 red signal+mark, 6 green signal.
 * No owner state is serialized. invalidate only increments the shared counter;
 * each specialization flushes lazily when its next search is constructed.
 * Panics/OOM abort; environmental exceptions terminate inside noexcept leaves. */

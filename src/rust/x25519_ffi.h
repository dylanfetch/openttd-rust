 * heap, application callback, direct vendor import or C++ unwind through Rust.
 * Buffers are original fixed readable/writable 32-byte spans; output may overlap
 * secret/scalar/point, including partial overlap. All inputs are read before
 * output serialization. Trim separately retains literal FORWARD byte-copy
 * behavior, including propagation for forward overlaps; it is not memmove.
 * Coarse ladder callers supply 255/256 bits. No C++ field representation crosses
 * ABI; internal ten-limb Rust storage preserves signed bounds/carry/shifts.
 * No pointer survives a call. Serialized operations, Rust panic aborts. Original
 * wipe points/order remain; no complete compiler-copy/spill erasure claim. */

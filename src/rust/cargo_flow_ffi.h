/* Each facade has one opaque owner or a nonowning borrow of a stable map entry.
 * Maps own raw-allocated flow nodes, unchanged by insertion or unrelated erase.
 * Share/origin iterators retain scalar keys only; each read borrows for that call.
 * All operations are serial; job maps are private to their worker until join.
 * No C++ STL object is viewed by Rust. Clone returns an independent owner;
 * map insertion copies the supplied flow. Destroy each owned handle once.
 * A map borrow ends when that entry is erased; no retained Rust reference crosses
 * a service. Services are noexcept, never run script VMs, and may read/mutate
 * canonical cargo through rerouting; raw owner accesses end before each call.
 * Save/load errors remain entirely in C++ adapters. Panics/alloc failures abort.
 * read: 0 graph valid,1 size,2 station,3 live station valid,4 edge count,
 * 5 edge flow,6 destination node,7 live edge exists (node,dest),
 * 8 manual distribution,9 live data empty,10 live graph ID,11 live node ID,
 * 12 job graph ID,13 edge last-update valid,14 edge unrestricted-update valid. finish clears data when requested
 * then invalidates the station window. Native thread join precedes application.

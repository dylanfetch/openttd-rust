 * Read/write leaves are noexcept and cannot reenter. Direct services are noexcept;
 * shell allocation may construct a separate Rust owner, and the shared flight
 * helper accesses the raw flags field only during its call. RNG is synchronous.
 * Only delete (2), RoadVehicle::Crash (14), and CMD_LANDSCAPE_CLEAR (17) return
 * actions for lifetime/NewGRF/nested release hooks. C++ completes them without
 * Rust borrows and owns continuation cleanup on exceptions. Panic aborts. */

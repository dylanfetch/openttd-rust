 * Rust retains no C++ pointer. It owns intermediate/output storage and checks
 * output length before append. Allocation failure/panic abort; ABI never unwinds.

 * Keep the original encoded input live until ordered diagnostics are replayed.
 * Replay preceding diagnostics before the first enabled assertion; never commit
 * output after that assertion. There is no second size pass or duplicate logging.

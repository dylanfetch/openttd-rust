/* Actual context lifetime starts in C++; immutable initialized layout/leaves
 * are borrowed synchronously. Fieldwise raw access handles actual u64 alignment;
 * no context padding is read and final wipes its complete actual storage.
 * Context is distinct from message/key/hash according to original incremental
 * preconditions. For hashes, one-shot output may overlap message/key, including
 * partial overlap: inputs are consumed before output writes. This deliberately
 * differs from cipher text aliasing. No external buffer becomes a Rust reference.
 * Empty message/key may be NULL; update(NULL, 0) accesses no context/layout.
 * Original readable/writable extents <=isize::MAX apply. No size validation is
 * added: init preserves supplied hash_size; final writes min(hash_size,64).
 * Keys <=128 reproduce defined source storage, though documented usage is <=64;
 * larger keys overrun original storage and have no compatibility guarantee.
 * No allocation, retained pointers, callback registration or C++ unwinding.
 * Panics abort. Original temporary wipe points are unchanged. */

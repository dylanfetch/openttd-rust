 * Rust. Leaves are synchronous noexcept/nonreentrant shared map/follower queries
 * and debug output. follow returns INVALID_TILE on failure; aqueduct returns its
 * other end or INVALID_TILE. Initialized outputs are exclusive for each call.
 * Visitor cursor owns only traversal progress and copied per-side labels. next
 * returns before arbitrary C++ visitor work; no cache borrow survives it. The
 * next call observes live cache changes at the original observation points.
 * Map replacement during a visitor violates the original region-reference
 * lifetime. Destroy each owner/cursor once, including visitor exception paths.
 * Panics/OOM abort; no exception or panic crosses the ABI. */

/* One shell owns one zero-created state; destroy once after final use. get/set:

 * Tables are copied for a synchronous invocation. Context is its live C++ shell;
 * observe output is call-scoped. Leaves cannot reenter, throw, retain pointers or
 * destroy the shell. Environmental allocation/log failures terminate.
 * Write fields:0 x,1 y,2 z,3 sprite sequence.Set,4 scalar sprite,5 progress,
 * 6 spritenum. Writes occur immediately in original order. Sound:0 fail,1 success.
 * No private-owner reference survives a leaf. run returns 1 alive,0 expiry;
 * C++ performs deletion only after return, including destructor/pool hooks.
 * Save/load get/set use existing C++ staging; controllers never run from loading.
 * Original subtype/table/coordinate preconditions apply; Rust panics abort. */

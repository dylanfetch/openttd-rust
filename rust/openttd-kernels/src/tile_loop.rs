//! Complete tile scheduler. Native arrays stay canonical; existing Rust owners
//! dispatch directly without a native trampoline. All panics abort at the C ABI.
//!
//! Batch settings are invariant under the original serialized game-state mutex:
//! map allocation/load, tick advancement, setting commands and AI/Game script VMs
//! run outside `RunTileLoop`. Ambient callbacks run only the `NewGRF` sound resolver;
//! tile handlers may mutate tiles/pools, run landscape/road/crash commands or queue
//! script events, but none changes map dimensions, climate, tree placement, tick
//! counter, editor mode, road-rebuild or client ambient settings. Generation progress also runs outside this
//! entry. `_misc_grf_features` is changed by reset and GRF `ActionD` loading,
//! both excluded from this batch. The ambient callback feature bit is captured
//! per independent entry, never cached globally or substituted by client audio.
//! Enabled callbacks retain their source RNG position; the tree legacy adapter
//! still rereads the feature bit after its call. Thus settings are entry-local;
//! tree/map observations still occur inside each owner at original callback sites.
//!
//! Raw type descriptor lifetime: `Map::Allocate` is reached only from game reset
//! (`InitializeGame`), MAPS/legacy loaders and tests. Mutex yield (`GameLoopPause`)
//! occurs only in generation progress and GRF scanning; warmup callers place it
//! outside this entry. `VideoDriver::GameLoop`/GUI input hold the game-state mutex;
//! bootstrap is serial. House/ambient/animation `NewGRF` resolvers, road/landscape
//! commands, water foundations/crashes/destruction, cargo and industry callbacks
//! may mutate later tiles and reenter owners, but never run reset/load/progress or
//! a script VM. AI/Game event insertion only queues via `InsertEvent`; script VMs
//! run after this batch. Window invalidation cannot pump GUI commands here.
//! Therefore only allocation metadata can span dispatch; each u8 read ends first.
//! Nested entries acquire independently, and entries after reset reacquire. Link
//! graph workers own copies; sound/compression do not mutate the arrays. Threaded
//! and arbitrary `NewGRF` corpus limits remain source-review obligations in #156.

//! Shared vehicle boundary used by every vehicle port: one opaque handle, the
//! base-`Vehicle` and `GroundVehicle` service tables and constants. Shared map
//! operations and arithmetic live in `services.rs`. The tables are defined once in `src/rust/vehicle_ffi.h` and filled
//! with designated initializers in `src/rust/vehicle_services.cpp`.
//!
//! A handle is a live `Vehicle *`, valid until the service that deletes it.
//! Services are synchronous and `noexcept`; none retains a Rust reference, and
//! callers end every owner borrow before calling one that can reenter Rust.

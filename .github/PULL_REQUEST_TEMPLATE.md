Agent: <agent path> | Model: <exact model> | Reasoning effort: <effort>

## Moved to Rust

<!-- The state and control flow Rust now owns. One short paragraph or list. -->

## Stays in C++

<!-- The facade and callbacks that remain, and why each one is needed. -->

## Checks

<!-- Exact commands run, and their results. Harness scenarios that exercise this component. -->

## Simulation speed

<!-- Play-save benchmark before/after candidate/reference median wall ratios, commits and exact command; explain regressions above the roadmap budget. For non-simulation changes, say not applicable. -->

## Metrics

<!-- Paste python3 tools/port-metrics.py: original C++ retired, fork glue added/removed and signed net glue remain separate. Conversions report net glue. If original retirement is no greater than net glue plus tooling added, explain why. Use --whole-fork for total retirement and simulation-source share; this is a source-line measure, not behavioral completion. -->

## Known limits

<!-- Divergences, uncovered input domains, and follow-up issues. "None" is a valid answer. -->
